# Alta Snowfall Analysis

============================

Skiers love skiing in good snow conditions with fresh snowfall, but most skiers (and certainly many of the big spenders in skiing) have to book their ski trips far in advance of a reasonable weather forecast. However, some areas may have snowfall patterns that can be studied to determine if some weeks or months of the ski season receive more snowfall than other times. Even the slight chance that resort will fair better would provide a skier with valuable knowledge in booking a vacation.
